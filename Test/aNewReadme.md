## aNewReadme.md file

The class repository was forked and this markdown file, `aNewReadme.md`, was created under `Test` directory. 

This line was added in my local computer.

This line was added in the forked Github repo and newly created branch in the repo `branch1`. 

The intended `branch1` above was actually named wrong as `breanch1` so it was removed and new branch `NewBranch` was created and this line was 
added in the new branch `NewBrnach`.
